        Hello! Happy 7th Monthsary for us. I composed this gift to be original 
        and for you to receive a unique gift coming from me. I made this webpage even 
        though it takes a long time to make. I'm very much sorry that it takes a looooooong time.
        I love you so much my LOVE. I hope that this relationship will last until lifetime.
        Anyway our anniversary is coming closer and closer and I'm excited for that one.
        7 months of our sharing of love despite the shortcomings, challenges and lapses that 
        we have, We are still together overcoming our obstacles that come in our way.
        We are both busy in each other life but we still find a way to spend time. For all
        the support that you have given me. I will be forever grateful for that. I miss you.
        Every time that we spent together is not wasted time for me.  Even though there are times that we are tired of
        each other. We adjust and compromise for each other. Words can't express how much i love you.
        It is so difficult what you are going through righ now, let me be the pillar that will lift you up when you are fleeing
        that you want to give up. I strongly believe that you have bright future ahead of yours. Don't give up mahal ko.
        You are my GREATEST LOVE in my life. I am taking care of you yet take care of your health also my love.
        I'm sorry for the times that i have outburst, lash out and sarcastic comments.  I'm changing and adjusting all of my negative behaviour
        while retaining the good ones from the start.
        </p>
